This repo utilizes the hanabi learning environment available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/hanabi-learning-environment

Our model is based on Simplified Action Decoder from https://github.com/codeaudit/hanabi_SAD, which is a fork from https://github.com/facebookresearch/hanabi_SAD prior to the publication of the '"Other-Play" for Zero-Shot Coordination' paper.
